# undertale-box-bot

discord bot for generating undertale text boxes. i shouldn't have to explain this.

## setup

1. copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out. don't ask me for the token.
2. `npm install`
3. `node deploy-commands.js` to upload commands.
4. `node scraper.js` if you want characters. it's slow.
5. `node index.js`

## usage

`/box character:sans text:heya expression:wink`

it probably works.
