# undertale-box-bot

discord bot for generating undertale text boxes. i shouldn't have to explain this.

## setup

1. copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out. don't ask me for the token.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run deploy` for guild or `npm run deploy:global` for global.
4. `node scraper.js` if you want characters. it's slow.
5. `node index.js`

## how to use
it's not complicated.
1. use `/box character: <name> text: <dialogue>` to make a box.
2. picking an expression is optional. if you're lazy, it defaults to "default".
3. use the buttons on the message to edit it. saves you from typing the command again.
4. use `/help` if you forget this. somehow.

it probably works.
